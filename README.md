##Is It Cool?
###Gist 


Is It Cool is a SPA made with mobile in mind. The idea came from wanting to know if an event is cool or not in real time. Users can create events and reviews on events they are attending. The most difficult part of this project was working with angular and rails to achieve secure authentication/authorization. 

###Tech
Rails, JavaScript, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, Twitter REST API, and bootstrap.
